![Preview-Screen](https://github.com/RafaelCunhafs/tdd-shopping-list/blob/main/Preview.png)

## About this Project

Shopping List is an application to create a list of things that will be purchased.

## Why?

This project is an activity of the class "Fundamentos de Teste de Software" (PUC Minas - Sistemas de Informação) for the development of a project using TDD, that consists of testing before developing.
I chose React because I want to learn how to develop applications with this framework and for the tests I used the Jest and Enzyme frameworks that fit well with the proposed test method.

## Guide

This project was made following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1E08i2UJGI) tutorial for develop the list and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmdf1oATQo)  for develop using TDD.

## Features included
- Create list item
